        <h2>About Chris</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Chris, a 33-year-old male with a background in exercise physiology. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Kinesiology and a passion for health and fitness.

        <p>
            My journey has taken me through personal training, support and operations roles, and management positions at various tech companies such as Uber, DoorDash, and Bird. I've gained experience in driver and merchant operations in addition to managing scooter deployment strategies.

            While I'm new to coding, I'm excited to use the power of AI technology to create incredible digital experiences. My future projects include a fitness app rooted in methodology and precise data, as well as a sci-fi fantasy illustrated novel. I'm thrilled to embark on this coding journey and explore the endless possibilities it offers.
